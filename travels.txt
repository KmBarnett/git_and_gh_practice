My favorite Vacation: I went on a cruise with all my cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents from my mom's side of the family. My grandparents won the newly-wed game and I wont the Belly flop contest with a standing ovation our family was ship celebrities people would come up and say hello it was a real blast.
My favorite travel experience: when i was young like really young 6 or 7 my mother, sister and I were driving down to Albuquerque, NM and it was cold and we thought we would run out of gas. I told my mother it would be fine we could stay warm I could get into the left leg of a pair of her pants and my sister can git into the other and we will be warm and you can use the blanket. We tell this story whenever a story about kids just saying whatever comes into their minds comes up.
